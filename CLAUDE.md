# CLAUDE.md

Incline is a Rust 2024 mine design app — one binary for Windows/macOS/Linux/WebAssembly on `winit` + `wgpu` + `egui`.

## Working economy

Search the relevant subtree, not the repo: `rg -n 'draw_screen_cross' src/rendering`. Exclude `target/` and `dist/`. Read matching functions and their callers, not whole files. Don't re-read a file you just edited or re-run a check that passed until code changed. Run only the checks the change warrants — a UI tweak needs no web build. Keep the table below current when moving code.

### Where things live

Paths relative to `src/`.

| Task | Start here |
| --- | --- |
| Add a UI action | `ui/state.rs` (`UiCommand`, `console_report_spec`) → UI call site → `app/commands/mod.rs` (match arm, `requires_project`) |
| Change state | `app/mod.rs` (durable), `ui/state.rs` (`EditorState`, transient), `model/project.rs` (projects) |
| Fix rendering | `rendering/graphics/init.rs` (pipelines), `passes.rs` (draw passes), `rendering/scene/` (geometry + caches), `rendering/shaders/` (WGSL) |
| Background work | `app/jobs.rs` |
| Persistence | `model/formats/`, `model/atomic_file.rs` (native), `app/web_storage.rs` (browser) |
| Translations | `src/i18n.rs`, `i18n/en/Incline_Design.ftl` |

`examples/` holds an import-ready project with real data for manual validation; format fixtures live in `src/model/formats/fixtures/`.

## Commands

Toolchain is pinned **nightly**; `.cargo/config.toml` sets `build-std`, so a cold build compiles `std` too. Linux links with `clang` + `mold`.

```bash
cargo check                 # fast loop
cargo clippy
cargo run                   # desktop app
cargo fmt
cargo test
trunk serve                 # web build on :8080 (COOP/COEP headers in Trunk.toml)
trunk build --release
```

`rustfmt.toml` sets `max_width = 180` and `group_imports = "StdExternalCrate"` — long single-line signatures are deliberate, don't hand-wrap them.

No standing test suite. For substantive logic changes add a focused `#[test]` in an adjacent `#[cfg(test)]` module, run it, then **delete it** before committing. Validate rendering and interaction changes against `examples/`, and report validation gaps.

## Architecture

### The command round-trip

Data flows one way; the UI never mutates application state.

```
winit event → App::window_event (app/mod.rs) → app/events.rs (input, redraw)
  → Gui::render (ui/mod.rs) → draw_ui → UiFrameOutput { commands, geometry_dirty }
  → App::handle_ui_commands (app/commands/mod.rs) → per-domain impl in app/commands/*.rs
```

`draw_ui` gets an immutable `UiProjectView`, `&mut EditorState`, and `&Document`; anything else it wants changed it requests by pushing a `UiCommand`.

### Menus exist in three parallel places

`ui/elements/main_menu.rs` (menu bar), egui context menus (`ui/elements/explorer.rs` for tree entries, `ui/dialogs/editing.rs::draw_right_click_context` for the canvas), and `src/mac.rs` (native `NSMenu`: its own `MacMenuAction` enum, a mapping back to `UiCommand` in `app/mod.rs`, and an enable/check sync pass). Adding or removing an item means editing the egui site *and* `mac.rs`.

### State ownership

- **`App`** (`app/mod.rs`) — durable: `ProjectStore` workspace, open entities, undo `History`. Many fields `#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]`-gated.
- **`EditorState`** (`ui/state.rs`) — transient: active tool, `selected_handles`, hidden/frozen sets, dialog flags. Small changes inline; larger transitions via `EditorState::apply_action(EditorAction)`, which returns whether geometry must rebuild.
- **`UiProjectView`** — derived from `App` each frame, cached behind an allocation-free fingerprint (`ui_project_view_cache`).

Selection is uniform via `SceneEntityId` (`Object` / `Triangulation` / `BlockModel` / `DrillHole` / `PointCloud`); `rendering/query.rs` and `rendering/pick.rs` return one, so viewport features match on the variant rather than consulting per-kind lists.

### Invalidation and caching

`App::invalidate_geometry()` is called from ~90 sites, mostly editor-state changes with untouched documents. It stays cheap because the composite `scene_document`, the snap index, and the GPU caches in `rendering/scene/*_cache.rs` rebuild only when `ProjectStore::composite_key()` changes. **Never introduce an unconditional per-frame rebuild of scene or cache data.**

### Rendering

Hand-written wgpu renderer (`rendering/graphics/`, WGSL in `rendering/shaders/`); egui composites on top in the same encoder with `LoadOp::Load`. Vertex positions are chunk-origin-relative so `f32` stays precise far from the world origin — keep domain coordinates in `f64` and rebase before GPU conversion.

The scene covers the whole window; the panels in `ui/chrome.rs` are painted over it, not clipped. A new **top-level** panel must do both halves: take `chrome::region_frame`, *and* hand its fill rect to the single `chrome::paint_regions` call at the end of `draw_ui` as a `chrome::Region`. Nested panels do neither. The explorer column is two regions — tree and properties — with a draggable seam.

### Persistence, jobs, wasm

`ProjectStore` holds `OpenProject`s; each item's `ProjectItemState` tracks `revision` vs `saved_revision` — the source of the `*` dirty markers. Native format is **OMF**; DXF, CSV, LAS/LAZ, GeoTIFF are import/export only. Writes go through `model/atomic_file.rs`.

`app/jobs.rs` is one generic job queue: compute closure plus owned inputs run on a worker pool, the apply closure runs App-side on the UI thread, and `JobKey` dependencies cancel stale jobs when their source changes. Use it instead of another bespoke `pending_*` vec and poll function.

wasm is `panic = "abort"` (the job queue's panic recovery does *not* apply), needs COOP/COEP for shared memory and the `wasm-bindgen-rayon` pool, and persists to IndexedDB via `app/web_storage.rs`. Anything touching files or threads needs a native path *and* a wasm path.

## Conventions

- **Translate user-facing text.** `tr!("message-id")`, `tr!("greeting", name = who)`, or the literal forms `tr!(literal = "Apply")` / `tr_format!` (see `src/i18n.rs`). New keys go in `i18n/en/Incline_Design.ftl`.
- `userspace_log!` / `userspace_warn!` / `userspace_error!` (`src/logging.rs`) surface messages in the in-app activity console; plain `log::` macros only reach the log file.
- `themed_icon!(ui, "name.svg")` / `unthemed_icon!("name.svg")` embed SVGs from `res/ui/` at compile time; `themed_icon!` picks between `icons_dark/` and `icons_light/`.
- **One corner radius for the whole window.** Panel regions (`chrome::REGION_RADIUS`), floating tiles, toolbar buttons, anything new — all use `widgets::toolbar::GROUP_CORNER_RADIUS`. Never pick a radius by eye.

## Git

- Short, action-oriented commit subjects; no mandatory prefix scheme. Keep PRs focused: problem, resulting behaviour, validation, platform limitations.
