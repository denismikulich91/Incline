//! The Drill & Blast workspace's products panel, down the window's right edge.
//!
//! One region, claimed after the console and the bottom toolbar so it runs
//! from the viewport bar down to the toolbar's top edge and the two strips
//! below carry on underneath it, the way the explorer's column is claimed
//! before them and they stop at its edge.
//!
//! What is in it is a palette of cards rather than a list: a product is
//! recognised by its colour and its delay at a glance while a pattern is being
//! tied in, which is what the card shows. Interhole delays are the only
//! product so far - see [`crate::ui::state::DelayProduct`] - so the palette is
//! one section, and a new kind would be another beside it.
