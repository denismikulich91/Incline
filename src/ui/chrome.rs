//! Window chrome: the rounded regions the panels read as, and the gap of
//! window background between them.
//!
//! Panels stay rectangular as far as layout is concerned. The rounding is
//! painted over the finished frame, the way Blender masks its editor corners
//! (`screen_draw_edges` in `screen_draw.cc`): the region's own fill is drawn
//! rounded, then a ring of window background is stroked around the outside of
//! that shape afterwards. Anything a child painted into the corners - a nested
//! panel's fill, the tree's row banding, the 3D scene itself - is cut back to
//! the same radius without any of it having to know the shape.
//!
//! The menu bar and the status bar are deliberately not regions: they span the
//! window and stay square, as Blender's global top bar and status bar do - and
//! they are painted in the gap's own colour rather than the panel surface, so
//! they read as the backdrop the regions are laid on rather than as two more
//! panels floating at the window's edges. See [`window_bar_frame`].
//!
//! A new top-level panel joins the look in two steps: take [`region_frame`]
//! and hand its rect to the [`paint_regions`] call at the end of `draw_ui`.
//! Panels nested inside one do neither - the region they sit in is what gets
//! rounded. A region asks [`show_separator_line`] whether to draw egui's line
//! on its claimed edge rather than suppressing it outright: with the chrome on
//! the gap already separates it from its neighbour and the mask covers where
//! the line lands, but with the chrome off that line is all there is.
//!
//! The whole look is one preference - see [`set_enabled`]. Turned off, every
//! function here degrades to the plain panel it dresses up: no gap, no
//! rounding, no mask, no grips.
